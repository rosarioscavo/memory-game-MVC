# memory-game-MVC

It's a mere memory card game but with strong adhesion to the MVC (Model–view–controller) Pattern and a responsive
layout.

> Model–view–controller is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

The game is made up of a total of 1024 lines of code with 18 classes.

## The interface

Once the game has started, you will be asked to choose how many pairs of cards to play with.

Once the number of pairs to play with has been chosen, you will see an interface similar to the one in figure 3.

The interface depends on the size of the windows and the number of pairs selected. Therefore, if the window is resized, the disposition of the cards will consequently change. In fact, the window is responsive.

To flip a card, click with a mouse button.
After having flipped two cards, they will remain bared if they are paired; otherwise, they will turn over again, following the game's classic rules.

At the end of the game, the user will be asked to either reset the game or exit.
